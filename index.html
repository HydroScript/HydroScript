        HydroScript is a work-in-progress dynamically-typed programming language transpiled to JavaScript.
        <br>
        The programming language is built based on JavaScript, but all keywords are replaced with operators.
        <br>
        The transpiler of the language is written in TypeScript and the language uses the file extension "hys".
        <br><br>
        Example code:
        <br>
        JavaScript
        <pre>
let count = 0;
function isDoubleEven(number) {
    return number % 2 % 2;
}
while (count <= 10000) {
    count += 1;
    console.log("The count is now", count);
    if (count % 2) console.log(isDoubleEven(count) ? "Even even number!" : "Even number")
}
console.log("Finished counting to 10000");</pre>
        HydroScript
        <pre>
count = 0
isDoubleEven = >- number number % 2 % 2
count <= 10000 -? {
    count += 1
    console.log("The count is now", count)
    count % 2 ? console.log(isDoubleEven(count) ? "Even even number!" : "Even number")
}
console.log("Finished counting to 10000")</pre>
